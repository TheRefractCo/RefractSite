Create your own member cards.
- do absolutely anything you'd like, but keep it in the frame.
- code it in the ___Card.svelte file and keep styles and scripts in the same file.
- you can split your card into components (https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components), but place them in your designated subfolder.
    - also place assets such as SVGs there.
    - when you type in the name of the component, vscode should autocomplete the import and update it when you move the file.
Make sure to have the Svelte extensions installed (you should be prompted in the bottom left upon opening the file)
